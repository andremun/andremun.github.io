I am a Research Fellow (Level B) at the [School of Computer and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/) (CIS), [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/); and the ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications ([OPTIMA](https://optima.org.au/)). Before joining CIS and OPTIMA in January 2022, I was a Research Fellow (Level B) at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, from September 2017. Before that, I was a Research Fellow (Level A) at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Monash University, from March 2014. I received my Engineer's and Master's Degrees from the [Universidad del Valle](https://www.univalle.edu.co/) (Colombia) in 2005 and 2008 respectively; and my doctorate from The University of Melbourne in 2014.

The primary focus of my research is **analysing the relationship between algorithm performance and problem structure, emphasising learning and optimisation algorithms applied to black-box optimisation (BBO) problems**. In other words, I am interested in answering the questions:

* What makes a problem instance easy or hard for an algorithm?
* Is the difference in performance the result of intrinsic biases? and
* How to exploit this knowledge for the selection and design of algorithms?

While strongly related to the **Algorithm Selection Problem**, my work attempts to **develop scientific benchmarking methodologies that move away from the status quo of competitive benchmarking**. My main contribution has been to the development of the [MATILDA](https://matilda.unimelb.edu.au/matilda/) computational engine for **Instance Space Analysis**. Complementing this primary focus, I am interested in developing interdisciplinary work, having published in fields as diverse as Biomechanics, Resources Engineering, Computational Biology and Corporate Social Responsibility.

I have published over 50 papers, including over 30 articles in leading journals. Moreover, I currently co-supervise six PhD students, while two PhD students have completed under my supervision.
